Here are the step-by-step instructions for creating a AUTOMATED PARALYSIS PATIENT HEALTHCARE
MONITORING SYSTEM USING IOT with four sensors (flex sensor, accelerometer sensor, spo2 sensor ,and temperature sensor) using the thingsspeak IoT application dashboard:

Step 1: Gather the necessary components

flex sensor
accelerometer sensor
spo2 sensor
temperature sensor
Step 2: Set up the hardware

Connect the flex sensor to the Raspberry Pi using the appropriate pins (refer to the sensor's datasheet or documentation).
Connect the accelerometer sensor to the Raspberry Pi using the appropriate pins.
Connect the spo2 sensor to the Raspberry Pi using the appropriate pins.
Connect the temperature sensor to the Raspberry Pi using the appropriate pins.
Mount the sensors securely on the plywood.


Step 3: get the thingsspeak.com site

Create a  account or log in if you already have one.

Step 4: Create a new Blynk project

Open the Blynk app and create a new project.
Choose the appropriate hardware (Raspberry Pi) and connection type (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.).
thingsspeak will provide you with an Auth screen, which you'll need later.


Step 5: Set up the Arduino IDE

Download and install the Raspberry Pi OS (Integrated Development Environment) on your computer.
Connect the Raspberry Pi to your computer desktop using a vji to hdmi converter cable.
Open the python IDE.


Step 7: Install required libraries

In the python IDE, 
Search for and include the necessary libraries for each sensor:
For the flex sensor, include the "Adafruit_ADS1x15" library.
For the spo2 sensor, include the "max30100" library.
For the accelerometer sensor, include the "Adafruit_ADS1x15 and smtplib" library.
For the temp sensor, include the "MLX90614" library.


Step 8: Write the python code

In the python IDE, create a new sketch and write the code to read data from the flex sensor, spo2 sensor,accelerometer sensor, and temp sensor.
Use the appropriate library functions to communicate with each sensor and retrieve sensor readings.
Implement the code to send the sensor data to the thingsspeak dashboard .
Insert the Auth Token obtained in Step 4 into the code.
Upload the code to the Raspberry Pi.

Step 9: Test the setup

Ensure that the Raspberry Pi is connected to a power source.
Check if the sensor readings are being displayed correctly on the thingsspeak dashboard.
Verify that the accelerometer sensor is providing accurate location information.


Step 10: Calibrate and adjust settings

Fine-tune the sensor readings by calibrating each sensor if necessary.
Adjust the thingsspeak dashboard settings and thresholds based on your requirements.
